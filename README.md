<h4> Python Project</h4>
Simple menu display with billing receipt.
<br>
<br>
<h4>What is it?</h4>
My project is a Menu display and billing receipt which calculates the total price of selected items from the Menu section.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Input/Output Description:</h4>
This project is composed of two dictionaries (foods and drinks) that display the name of the item and its price in float (decimal) form. The computer runs through the code and prints out both dictionaries, then asks the user to input what items they would like to buy along with their price based on the information given. Then, the computer should print out the name of the selected items along with the overall price for all items.
